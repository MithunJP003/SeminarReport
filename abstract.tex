The integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with LoRa wireless technology is transforming long-range, low-power communication for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. UAV-aided LoRa networks enable rapid deployment, flexible coverage, and robust connectivity in remote, disaster-affected, or infrastructure-limited areas. This report explores the fundamentals of UAV and LoRa technologies, their combined advantages, and system architectures tailored for field applications such as environmental monitoring, emergency response, and smart cities. Key challenges—including limited bandwidth, UAV power constraints, and signal interference—are addressed with practical solutions that enhance network reliability and scalability. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of UAV-LoRa synergy in real-world scenarios, highlighting its promise as a resilient and energy-efficient platform for next-generation wireless communications.
